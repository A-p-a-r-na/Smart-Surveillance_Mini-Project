# Smart-Surveillance_Mini-Project
A python application, which can detect a variety of unusual activities on its own. Smart Surveillance can be used to monitor a particular location, to indicate
whether a motion has been detected in that region or not. Anti-theft feature has been
incorporated in to this project where it could identify the stolen object from the frame.
Another feature included is the Face Identification where it can be trained to recognise
people.This could also work as an alert system in which an alert is send through a mail
when a motion is detected.
